## :beginner: About

> Traditional way of Recruiting:

- Evaluating each incoming application is tedious and counterproductive.
- Recruiting the best candidates  for the requirement of a job  role can be cumbersome.
- Difficulty in keeping track of  promising applications which  werenâ€™t processed earlier.
<br>

> Why iProfiler?

<p>To filter based candidates out of the pool of them, iProfiler comes to the rescue. </p>

- We automate the manual resume screening by leveraging the *AI Resume Parsing* feature of the product.
- Multi-Filter provided by the application would help HR to segregate hundreds of generic profiles of users and only relevant will be saved for the later stage.
- Cloud-based storage allows 24/7  access to the applicants' data and  keeps it intact for future use.

Thus, iProfiler is a handy tool for all HR representatives.

> Note: Our target customers are the HR representatives of a firm.
